# **Project Title: Consumer Behavior Analysis on Online Shoppers Intention Dataset**
## **Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing consumer behavior using the "Online Shoppers Intention" dataset. This dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and hosted on Kaggle, includes data on various factors influencing the shopping intentions of online customers.

## **Objectives**
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the behavior of users visiting an e-commerce website. This includes:

* Identifying patterns and trends in user behavior.
* Classifying users based on their likelihood of making a purchase.
* Providing actionable insights for improving business strategies.
## **Dataset**
The dataset comprises 12,330 instances with 18 attributes, including both numerical and categorical data. Key attributes include:

* Administrative, Administrative_Duration: Pages related to site administration visited and the time spent on them.
* Informational, Informational_Duration: Informational pages visited and the time spent on them.
* ProductRelated, ProductRelated_Duration: Product-related pages visited and the time spent on them.
* BounceRates, ExitRates: Bounce and exit rates of the pages.
* Revenue: Indicates whether the session resulted in a transaction.
## **Methodology**
### **1. Data Preprocessing:**

* Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
* Transforming categorical variables into numerical values using encoding techniques.
* Scaling numerical features for better performance of machine learning models.
### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* Visualizing the distribution of data attributes.
* Identifying correlations between different attributes.
### **3. Clustering:**

* Applying clustering algorithms to group users with similar behaviors.
* Using techniques such as K-Means and hierarchical clustering.
* Analyzing clusters to derive insights on user engagement and shopping patterns.
### **4. Classification:**

* Building classification models to predict whether a user will make a purchase.
* Using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
* Evaluating models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## **Results**
The project aims to deliver insights into:

* The characteristics of users who are likely to make a purchase.
* Key factors that influence the purchasing decision.
* Recommendations for enhancing user engagement and increasing conversion rates.
